# BarChartPro

BarChartPro is a Python program that allows you to create custom bar charts. With this program, you can input data and visually represent it in the form of a bar chart.

## Installation

Before using BarChartPro, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary library using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
````

## Usage
Follow these steps to run BarChartPro:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the "BarChartPro.py" file is located.
3. Run the program by entering the following command:

python BarChartPro.py
`````

The program will start and guide you through the process of creating a custom bar chart. It will ask you for the number of bars and then collect labels and values for each bar.

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the program:

Welcome to a bar chart generator!
Enter the number of bars: 3
Enter the label for bar 1: A
Enter the value for bar 1: 20
Enter the label for bar 2: B
Enter the value for bar 2: 35
Enter the label for bar 3: C
Enter the value for bar 3: 15


The program will then create a bar chart based on the entered data.
